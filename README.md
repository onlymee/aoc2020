Just my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) 2020 

## Usage
Generally solutions to the daily problems are found in a subfolder `dayX` where `X` is the day 1 thru 24.  
In that folder will be a source file with the same name and extension for the corresponding language.  
Where it is convenient to split problem halves the source files may be denoted `dayX-1` and `dayx-2` 
correspondingly.

I tend to pick the language inspires me on the day, depending on the problem so it could be C, C++, Java, 
Python, Javascript, Haskell, Fortran, ... possibly a few other things.  I'm not ashamed to solve in Excel 
if there could be a particularly elegant solution.

Where solutions require compilation, there *should* be a Makefile so entering the folder and simply typing `make`
should result in the executable binary artefacts named appropriately.
